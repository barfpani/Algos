# Algos

Here I'll be adding my all the hands on work and learning about Algorithms and little bit about Data Structures.

I've included the object files too! So you just have to fork this repository,
then make a local repo on your PC, pull from your CMD or terminal and to 
run these algorithms just type "./filename.o" in your code editor terminal, Ofc
without the inverted commas. :)
